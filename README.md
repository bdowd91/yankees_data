I am attempting to analyze the effect of playing for a new team on a player's performance. I compiled the transaction history from the Wikipedia page for each individual season (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_New_York_Yankees_season). I retrieved the statistics from baseball-reference.com. The csv files were created manually. I was not able to scrape any information. My goal is to determine how much switching teams during a season impacts performance compared to switching teams in the offseason.
